# Lingist Assist

##### A tool to help children, adults, native English speakersm and English as a second language improve their spelling and vocabulary

## Hear words and definitions and then type out the word

###### Select from pre-built lists, perfect for young yearners or those trying to study for the SATs. 

###### Select your missed words and see if you can get your words right this time around

###### Define how many rounds you want to play. The game's progress is dynamic, and the progress bar will match accordingly. 

## How it works

###### Lingust Assist is built with Django, Vue.js, and Sass.

###### It uses two apis. One to get the definitions of the words, and one to get the voice you hear in the game.

###### During the game, the app handles its post and fetches requests with Axios to not fresh the page. This process also allows the data to instantly be stored, and for further front-end manipulation.

###### The 1st-grade through 9th-grade spelling lists were grabbed from educational resources. I then wrote a simple python program to parse the data (the words) I got online, putting each word into lists of strings.
